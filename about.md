My name is Pruthvi Raj. I've been working as a Software Engineer since Feb 2021. And I have been simultaneously learning and working on my skills for getting into Cybersecuirty domain.

#### exploring/working on
network analysis, reverse engineering and malware anlysis and exploit development

#### modus operandi
<!-- I love speaking different languages. I can speak English, Kannada and Hindi, learnt Sanskrit in School. I can understand Telugu and Tamil (to an extent). 
I love studying History, Geography, current affairs, DIY hacks and all the small things in life. -->

I like to think about a problem like a puzzle and keep working on it. I love making extensive research and gain more knowledge while working on things everyday. That's when I found out about Cybersecurity, under Lockdown early 2021. The depth of all job roles seen in this domain match with all the things I would love to be working on everyday.

Since then, I have worked on getting those skills checked in.\
Enter tagline: **pursuing infosec with a daily exploration strategy**

I'll let you know when I find out more about myself.
