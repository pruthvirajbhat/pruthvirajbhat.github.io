I'm Pruthvi. I've been working as a Software Engineer for over 12 months. I like to innovate to solve challenging problems using technology. I have Imposter Syndrome and have observed nearly most of all ADHD symptoms (without the doctor's word as of now). 

I like to think about a problem like a puzzle and keep working on it. I love making extensive research and gain more knowledge while working on things everyday. That's when I found out about Cybersecurity, under Lockdown early 2021. The depth of all job roles seen in this domain match all the things I would love to be working as.

Since then, I have worked on getting those skills checked in.\
Enter tagline: **pursuing infosec with a daily exploration strategy**

I love speaking different languages. I can speak English, Kannada and Hindi, learnt Sanskrit in School. I can understand Telugu and Tamil (to an extent). Would love to learn Spanish and Chinese.

I have develeoped a recent interest in Music while in Lockdown and am learning how different instruments work.

I love studying History, Geography, current affairs, DIY hacks and all the small things in life.

I'll let you know when I find out more about myself.
