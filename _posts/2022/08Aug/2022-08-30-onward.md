The ricing bug bit me hard. Moved on from the old GNOME DE for personal OS Ubuntu to MATE DE for cleaner experience, faster response and minimal animation. The system was cleaned thoroughly, checked multiple times to remove all unwanted files, apps (including terminal applications) and make the system faster to use, clutterless and clear storage. 

Clear storage speaks in volumes about my space - what I am doing, what I have and what I need to do. Removed many files that were outdated to backup HDD. There also was a 43.5 GB cache file in /root/.cache hiding all the time when disk usage analyzer was run. Finally removed it all. Now it's as clear as it can be.
