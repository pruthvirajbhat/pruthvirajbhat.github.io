# forcing myself to learn vim
well everywhere I turned online, everyone kept saying that vim is cool, powerful, 1337 etc

and I felt I didn't want to learn it.
At first it was terminal-ish and I hated it in college where once had great problems while quitting the damn window! And since then I had a hatred to it, and opted out for the cooler *nano* editor, which was great in it's own way

Then I got around to the tutorial of freecodecamp on youtube, just some 1 hour. done by NeuralNine (i love his vids, I just rarely watch them in fascination at the marvelous things he does), the [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ4p-saaQkc) was some one hour and I felt ehh.. should give it a try. Postponed it for 2 days until I sat down firmly and got into the entire video.

Damn. Vim is super powerful. Just by properly using it, I can easily eliminate the dual use of mouse and keyboard. I hated to always double quote, put brackets twice and some regular things to be done repeatedly using mouse and keyboard. I always love to sticking to just keyboard and this gave me **the** chance. 

Consistent practice will get those bindings inside my head. And vim as a skill in my kitty. 
Need a purpose to get myself to learn some coding projects or scripting stuff. If so, vim is in! Mostly there's no reason for me to code/anything_else and I end up losing that skill with laziness, passing time and inconsistency. Hopefully this doesn't repeat now.
