Write more of these here.
The Machine was booted up and run - intended to be the target. Specs set to be 1cpu and minimum RAM as required. 
The Kali Linux machine is the operating/attacking machine.

Running a Nmap scan provides some service to be already running. Apache - web server. Use the IP address to see that it hosts a website. The website happens to have Drupal. Searchsploit was utilised to see what vulnerabilities it has.

Many vulnerabilities were shown. Utilizing each such vulnerabiliy and trying it on the machine.

Boom. Access granted. But it feels like I'm using tools, and knowing what it does on a high level. Not writing code and making new progress. Need to cross that layer of abstraction.
