Russian special/military intelligence services

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the intelligence responsibilities of the KGB were divided into newly created branches of intelligence. This includes the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), the Federal Protective Service (FSO) and the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GU), more commonly known by its Soviet era name, the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

Each of these groups plays a role in Russian cyberspace but the FSOâ€™s responsibilities and jurisdiction are domestically oriented and it is not believed to be affiliated with any Russian cyber actors.

## 1. APT28
**Active since**: 2004
**Also called**: GRU, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit, Tsar Team, STRONTIUM
Attributed to: Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS) military unit 26165

Some of these were conducted with the assistance of GRU Unit 74455, which is also referred to as Sandworm Team.

### Latest Attacks by APT28
APT28 reportedly compromised the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016 in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.

In 2018, the US indicted five GRU Unit 26165 officers associated with APT28 for cyber operations (including close-access operations) conducted between 2014 and 2018 against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the US Anti-Doping Agency, a US nuclear facility, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Spiez Swiss Chemicals Laboratory, and other organizations.
