Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) is a stack of compatible software programs that enables an organization to collect data about security threats and respond to security events without human assistance. It is the process of executing these tasks—such as scanning for vulnerabilities, or searching for logs—without human intervention.

SOAR capabilities include:
-   The prioritization of potential threats.  
-   Assessing potential impact.  
-   Triaging the most important threats.
-   Responding to the threats accordingly.

Aspects of those capabilities are:
- Security orchestration and automation to create a strong security foundation, based on best practices.
- Security incident response platform to use as a tool for orchestrated security responses, establishing repeatable and scalable workflows.
- Threat intelligence usage to understand threats preemptively, accelerating prioritization, and after a security threat to confirm the incident is resolved.

SOAR tools provide machine-powered assistance to human analysts to improve the efficiency and consistency of people and processes by significantly enhancing security operations activities like threat detection and response.

The goal of using a SOAR platform is to improve the efficiency of physical and digital security operations. They streamline security operations in three key areas: threat and vulnerability management, incident response, and security operations automation.

Top SOAR vendors in 2023 from multiple Gartner (research and consulting firm) lists and other researchers' watchlist include 

1. PhishER, 
2. Swimlane, 
3. Chronicle SOAR, (offered by Google)
4. Splunk SOAR, 
5. Demisto SOAR, (by Palo Alto)
6. Cortex SOAR, (by Palo Alto)
7. Cyberbit Range, 
8. IBM SOAR, 
9. Trellix ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) (formerly known as McAfee), 
10. ServiceNow Operations, 
11. InsightConnect, (by Rapid7)
12. FortiSOAR, 
13. NextGen SOAR, 
14. Arcsight SOAR, 
15. ThreatConnect’s SOAR solution, 
16. SIRP SOAR Solutions, 
17. Siemplify SOAR solutions (now Google acquired), 
18. LogRhythm RespondX (part of XDR solution set)
19. DFLabs IncMan SOAR (now SumoLogic)

Most vendors' solutions have the same goals with added features relevant to market competitive prices. Integration of SOAR services with other security and network solutions are also provided, with maximum integration options with different companies' solutions for higher market penetration

### Benefits
- SOAR helps build workflows & streamline operations
- SOAR helps increase flexibility, extensibility, and collaboration
- Respond more quickly and accurately
- Improve analyst job satisfaction
- Improve time management and productivity
- Effectively manage incidents
- Automate repeated and error-prone tasks
- Simplify collaboration across operational teams

### Usefulness in SOC Environments
Compared to Security Incident and Event Management Solutions (SIEM), SOAR programs are often automated and typically do not require a large degree of expert human oversight to determine if the security events are false positives or actual incidents that require investigation. Time spent investigating and mitigating can be used much more efficiently and usefully.

SIEM tools typically need a degree of calibration and oversight to determine the accuracy of the data collected and to triage the more important data, which can be labor intensive.

Goal of such SOAR systems entail to:
1. reduce the resolution time to minimum
2. maximize analyst efficiency
3. maximize the increase in solution handled incidents 

Success with security is ideally the combination of SIEM and SOAR. A lot is dependent on the size and type of data gathered around events, and a larger organization could receive up to millions of alerts a day, which a SIEM will gather and analyze. 

But a lot of data analysis is required to process through all of the data, which is where SOAR can be used in conjunction with a SIEM to process and manage incident response much faster, removing the time consuming and laborious manual incident prioritization and response processes.
