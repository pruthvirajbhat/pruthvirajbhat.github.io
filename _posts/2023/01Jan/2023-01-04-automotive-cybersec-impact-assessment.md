Vehicles are considered "connected" when they share data between servers, apps and the vehicles' various compnents to enable telematics services, smart mobility services and more. Primary modes of vehicle connectivity are
1. Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I)
2. Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V)
3. Vehicle to Cloud (V2C)
4. Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P)
5. Vehicle to Everything (V2X)

Connected Vehicles are expected to account for a quater of all passenger cars worldwide by 2023. Computerized systems have been added to include additional personalization advanced technological capabilities with each mode of connectivity enabling more features. 

While connected components and systems are critical to enhancing vehicles’ capabilities, advancing autonomous vehicles (AVs), and providing better user experiences, they also introduce additional vulnerabilities and entry points for hackers to leverage.

Automotive cybersecurity is still a relatively new domain, developing quickly to keep up with the fast-paced technological developments in the industry and the increasing number of cyber incidents.

Threat actors from deep and dark web, including various private forums and Telegram accounts, enable automotive cyber criminals to communicate with relative anonymity. These forums with detailed discussions on how to attack connected vehicles, how to access sensitive data or how to take over and steal a vehicle. Even on surface web, cyber criminals can easily find online shops that sell exploitative tools and services.

Cybercrime (valued at $600 billion) is now more profitable than illegal drug trade (valued at $400 billion) and it's impact in automotive ecosystem is very worrying due to the potential direct impact on road users' safety and secuirty. With vehicles' connectivity leaves them vulnerable to remote attackers with malicious intent to cause physical harm, worst case secnario: death of hunderds or even thousands.

## Recent Threats
Numerous Cyber Incidents include
- Jan 2020 - 4,118 vehicles were stolen in India wit cheap electronic devices that enable the theives to bypass the engine control module, unlock the vehocle, start the engine and access the vehicles computer.
- Jan 2020 - A Mobileye 630 pro and Tesla Model X hack fooled the ADAS and autopilot systems to trigger the brakes and steer into oncoming traffic.
- Feb 2020 - 19 vulnerabilities were found in a Mercedes-Benz E-class car, allowing hackers to control the vehicle remotely, including opening it's doors and starting the engine.
- Apr 2020 - Attackers took full control of an OEM's corporate network by reverse engineering a vehicle's TCU and using the telematics connection to inflitrate the network
- May 2020 - Attackers found passwords and API tokens for Dailemr's Internal systems after source code of a connected car component was made publicly available.
- May 2020 - Attackers publicly offered to seel car info of 3.5 million zoomcar users on the dark web.
- May 2020 - Toll Group, an Australian transportation fleet, was hit with a ransomware attack for the second time in 2020 affecting 1,000 servers and 40,000 employees.
- Jun 2020 - Honda stopped production in a number of its plants after its networks in EU and Japan were attacked with the Snake ransomware.
- Aug 2020 - More than 300 vulnerabilities were found in over 40 ECUs developed by 10 Tier-1 companies and OEMs.
- Aug 2020 - Attackers was able to gain control over Tesla's entire connected vehicle fleet by exploiting a vulnearbility in OEMs server-side mechanism 

## Countering Automotive threats in deep and dark web
New automotive-related security vulnerabilities, data breaches of sensitive information, and other automotive-related cyber threats are consistently published and discussed on the deep and dark web. It is crucial that stakeholders keep an eye out and monitor these areas of the internet or risk severe gaps in their security posture. A key component in ensuring that effective cybersecurity protections are in place within an organization is knowing when and in what context an organization and products are being mentioned, both publicly and in the deep and dark web. 

Deep and dark web monitoring reduces the amount of time between the first exposure of a cyber breach or vulnerability in the dark web and its connection with a malicious stakeholder both within the framework of the dark web or on the surface web where it can reach the masses. 

It can also minimize the window of opportunity that criminals have to make copies of the breached data to sell, and warns about the potential exploitation of automotive partners, employees, key executives, and customers.

## Standards and regulations
A critical step in increased automotive cybersecurity took place in the form of the two new automotive cybersecurity requirements adopted and drafted in 2020, namely the United Nations WP.29 CSMS and SUMS regulations and the
ISO/SAE 21434 standard.

ISO/SAE 21434 is a baseline for vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to ensure that cybersecurity risks are managed efficiently and effectively.

As emphasized earlier in this section, many real-life cyber incidents correlate to more than one of the seven WP.29 cyber threat categories. One standout incident from April 2020 showcased this compounded threat level when a white-hat incident correlated to six of the seven threat categories of Annex 5. In a massive investigation, cyber researchers uncovered high-impact security flaws related to two of the UK’s best-selling cars, Volkswagen Polo and Ford Focus, including a vulnerability in the vehicles' infotainment software update process that was used to hack the unit (correlating to “threats to vehicles regarding their update procedures”). The researchers also discovered that the infotainment unit used third-party software libraries that had known security flaws (which relates to “threats to vehicles regarding their external connectivity and connections” and specifically relates to attack example 17.1 “corrupted applications, or those with poor software security, used as a method to attack vehicle systems”).

Ultimately, the regulations effectively make cybersecurity an
inviolable element of future connected vehicles.

## Automotive cybersecurity solution landscape
Automotive cybersecurity has been recognized as vital by players
within the automotive ecosystem such as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) as well as by outside regulatory bodies. As such, it is no surprise that a massive growth is predicted in the automotive cybersecurity market, with McKinsey predicting a rise from $4.9 billion in 2020 to $9.7 billion by 2030.

Following recent cybersecurity standards and regulations are one of the primary requirements for securing vehicle's entire lifecycle. It's achieved by
1. Security by design: Considering security of a compnent or software from the developement phase, hence designed, developed and tested for security vulnerabilities throughout the process - making not just OEMs but also supply chain suppliers part of the security practices implementation.
2. Implementing Muilt-Layered Cybersecurity solution: Improving perimemter secuirty, end-point solutions, cloud security, internal segmentation technology and more. Effectively having a Security Operations Center (SOC) with real-time cyber inident detection, activate mobility-specific playbooks and operate 24x7 comples a new form of SOC, Vehicle SCO (VSOC) or mobility SOC or car SOC or automotive SOC. With Vehicle Detection and Response (VDR) element of VSOC (advanced detection capabilities of known and unknown cyber threats and functionality that requires minimal staffing) and adaptive rules to changing cyber threat landscape - VSOC becomes critical to implementing effecitve automotive cybersecurity solutions.
3. Automotive-specific Threat Intelligence and compliment threat detection by utilising external sources of data will enable key stakeholders to better understand threat and solutions landscape for every layer of enterprise security personnel.
