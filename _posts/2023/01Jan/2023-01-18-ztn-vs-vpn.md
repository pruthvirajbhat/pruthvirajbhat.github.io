### Virtual Private Network
A virtual private network, or VPN, is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network. The encrypted connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted. It prevents unauthorized people from eavesdropping on the traffic and allows the user to conduct work remotely. VPN technology is widely used in corporate environments.

A VPN extends a corporate network through encrypted connections made over the Internet. Because the traffic is encrypted between the device and the network, traffic remains private as it travels. An employee can work outside the office and still securely connect to the corporate network. Even smartphones and tablets can connect through a VPN.

Secure remote access provides a safe, secure way to connect users and devices remotely to a corporate network. VPN technology is available to check whether a device meets certain requirements, also called a device’s posture, before it is allowed to connect remotely.

### Zero Trust Network
In this philosophy, any device, user, or application that tries to interact with your architecture is considered not safe. A broken trust model assumes that the identity of a user cannot be compromised unless he or she acts in a manner of trust. The value of using zero trust in the cloud is not only to enhance an organization's cloud security but also to enable them to use enterprise applications without compromising performance or user experience.

Zero trust is a security framework that requires all users on an enterprise network to authenticate, authorize, and validate security configurations and attitudes before granting or retaining access to applications and data

Zero Trust Network, or Zero Trust Architecture refers to a security concept in which the threat model no longer assumes that actors, systems, or services operate within a security area that can be trusted to ensure that anyone who tries to connect to their systems has access to it.

The US Department of Defense (DoD) Zero Trust reference architecture was designed to reduce the DoD's attack area and ensure that devices, networks, and users can be compromised, but the damage can be limited. It describes seven pillars of Zero Trust (user devices, network environment, application use, data visibility, analytics, automation, and orchestration) and outlines how Zero Trust capabilities are aligned.

This is effectively implemented using software-defined perimeters for security policy enforcement.

A software-defined perimeter is a modern approach to network security first developed by the US Department of Defense to address the weaknesses inherent to traditional approaches. The castle-and-moat paradigm tries to protect networked resources by creating a secure perimeter around the network. Hardware or virtualized appliances such as firewalls and gateways are used to secure entry points into the physical network (i.e., VPN). However, the resulting infrastructure is brittle, expensive, and presents a visible, large attack surface.

Adopting SDP security approaches eliminates the costs and vulnerabilities of the traditional appliance-based approach to network security. Rather than trying to defend a physical network, SDP focuses on protecting the logical network connecting a company’s resources to its users. The SDP model further separates the control layer from the data layer, so data connections are not created until the authentication and authorization process is complete.

Main principles behind Zero Trust Network include:

1. Continuous monitoring and validation 
2. Least Privilege
3. Device Access Control
4. Microsegmentation
5. Preventing Lateral Movement
6. Multi-Factor authentication

### Why Zero Trust Network is better than Virtual Private Network?
Assumptions of trust have made VPN itself the greatest security risk. Assuming that only trusted users need the information, for example, VPN gateways publish their IP address and device identifiers to the open internet where anyone can see them. Once a VPN gateway has been compromised, cybercriminals can traverse the network within just like any trusted user

VPN creates other issues for network administrators such as the way it undermines network efficiency. Regardless of the resource’s location, all traffic from remote users passes through the VPN gateway by default. The resulting impact on network performance creates poor user experiences that could undermine security compliance: some users simply switch off the VPN because it is slowing down their connection.

Zero Trust solutions eliminate the security and manageability issues of technologies like VPN. Among the benefits Zero Trust Network can deliver:

-  Dramatically smaller attack surfaces.
-  Limited lateral spread of successful breaches.
-  Faster deployment and scaling without additional infrastructure.
-  Unification of all security and access control policies.
-  Improved network performance.
-  Improved user experiences.
-  Easier security compliance.
