Digital forensics is the scientific process of identifying, collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence for the purpose of investigating digital-related crimes, incidents, or civil litigation. It involves the use of specialized techniques and tools to recover, preserve, and analyze digital data from a wide range of devices, including computers, mobile phones, servers, storage media, and other digital systems. The goal of digital forensics is to uncover and preserve evidence that can be used in court or in other legal proceedings, and to provide impartial and reliable information about digital events or activities.

The fundamentals of digital forensics include:

1.  Evidence preservation and collection
2.  Identification and documentation of digital evidence
3.  Analysis of digital data (e.g. computers, mobile devices, storage media)
	- Digital data is analyzed through a combination of technical and analytical processes. The specific techniques and tools used for digital data analysis will vary depending on the type of data and the goals of the analysis, but the overall process involves the systematic examination and interpretation of digital data to uncover relevant information and patterns. The general steps involved in digital data analysis are:
		1.  Data acquisition: The first step is to acquire a copy of the digital data to be analyzed. This can be done through a variety of methods, including direct access to the source device, imaging of the storage media, or other methods.
		2.  Data preservation: The acquired data is preserved in a manner that prevents any alteration or corruption of the original data.
		3.  Data filtering: The acquired data is filtered to remove any irrelevant or unnecessary information, reducing the amount of data to be analyzed.
		4.  Data analysis: The filtered data is then analyzed using specialized tools and techniques, such as file carving, data carving, keyword searches, pattern analysis, and others. The goal of this step is to uncover relevant information and patterns in the data.
		5.  Data interpretation: The results of the analysis are interpreted to determine the significance and relevance of the data to the investigation or case.
		6.  Report generation: A report is generated that summarizes the results of the analysis, including any relevant findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
4.  Recovery of deleted or hidden data
	- Recovering deleted or hidden data can be a complex process that requires specialized tools and techniques. It is important to note that the likelihood of successful data recovery will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of storage media, the method of deletion or hiding, the length of time since the data was deleted or hidden, and other factors. The exact steps involved in data recovery will depend on the specific situation, but some general steps are:
		1.  Data acquisition: The first step is to acquire a copy of the storage media containing the deleted or hidden data. This can be done through imaging or cloning the storage media.
		2.  Data analysis: The acquired data is analyzed using specialized data recovery software or hardware tools to search for deleted or hidden data. The tools can search for data using various methods, such as file carving, data carving, and unallocated space analysis.
		3.  File system analysis: The file system of the storage media is analyzed to determine the location of deleted or hidden data, such as deleted files, unallocated space, slack space, or other areas.
		4.  Data recovery: The recovered data is then restored to a new storage device or a location on the original storage media, if possible.
		5.  Data verification: The recovered data is verified to ensure its integrity and authenticity, and to confirm that the data is complete and usable.
5.  Authentication and validation of digital evidence
	- The authentication and validation of digital evidence is done through a combination of technical and legal processes. It involves the following steps:
		1.  Preservation: The first step is to preserve the digital evidence in a manner that prevents any alteration or corruption of the data.
		2.  Hashing: A unique digital signature, called a hash value, is generated for the original data using a hashing algorithm. This allows the authenticity of the evidence to be verified at a later time
		3.  Chain of custody: A record is kept of who had access to the evidence, when, and for what purpose, to establish the chain of custody. This helps to demonstrate that the evidence has not been altered or tampered with
		4.  Analysis: The digital evidence is analyzed using specialized tools and techniques to determine its authenticity and validity. This can include comparing the hash values of the original and analyzed data, as well as examining file metadata, timestamps, and other information
		5.  Expert testimony: In court or other legal proceedings, an expert witness can be called upon to provide testimony regarding the authenticity and validity of the digital evidence. The expert witness will use the results of the analysis and other information to support their testimony.
6.  Presentation of findings in a court of law.

Digital forensic analysis involves the use of scientific and technical methods to examine and analyze digital devices and data to uncover, collect, and preserve evidence for legal purposes.

Types of digital forensics include:

1.  Computer forensics
2.  Mobile device forensics
3.  Network forensics
4.  Database forensics
5.  Cloud forensics
6.  Memory forensics
7.  Forensic data analysis
8.  Internet of Things (IoT) forensics
9.  Audio/Video forensics
10.  Malware forensics
11.  Email forensics

Each type of digital forensics focuses on specific aspects of digital devices, networks, or data and applies specialized techniques and tools to recover, preserve, and analyze evidence.
