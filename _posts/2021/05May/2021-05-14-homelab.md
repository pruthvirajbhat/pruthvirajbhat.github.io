As of post writing, 14th May 2021: It's not a homelab per se, more of a "few things I have".

1. Laptop - Primary System
Currently I own a Lenovo Laptop Ideapad 320 i5 8th gen processor (8 GB RAM DDR4, 1 TB HDD) and 13 year old desktop PC (with pentium processor, 2 GB RAM DDR3 and 500 GB HDD).

On my primary system, the Laptop: I had Windows 10, but removed it entirely and wanted to dive deep into Linux. So, I installed Ubuntu as my base OS. It was torture at the beginning, now it's heaven.

The resources I have cannot support Virtualization. I/O delay in both Host OS and VM; RAM consumption shoot up to 95% due to lack of CPU (cores & cycles). 

2. Old PC
The old desktop PC had a Windows 7 on it. Removed it to install Debian 11 Bullseye for 32 bit pc with Xfce Desktop Environment (lightest of the Debian variants).

But here's the caveat with the Debian system's Behaviour:
when nothing is being done - CPU: 3% , Memory: 35%
when firefox opened, one video played - CPU: 90% , Memory: 79%

Looks nice on a computer stand though.

3. Raspberry Pi 4 - 8GB RAM
In Aug 2021, I got a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB RAM, few 32 GB SD Cards and a 500GB SSD.\
I'm on a tight budget, the rPI4 was a big deal on my bank account.

So only 2 practically feasible systems available.
## Homelab

With time, I'll grow my homelab with the things I have (as of now writing: end of 2021). But I'll make do with the things I have.\

When I get a new job in security I'll treat myself with a good workstation and start making and breaking things!
