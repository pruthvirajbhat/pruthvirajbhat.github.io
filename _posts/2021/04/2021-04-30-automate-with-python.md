This course is long and lenghty/extensive. A lot of ground is covered and some concepts are best learnt when situations arise when that concept needs to be implemented. Nonetheless, it's best to be through.

The book is beginner friendly. It leads with Part 1: Basics, covering different data types of python, %%(terms and keywords used while working in python)%% functions and methods.
Without wasting anything it moves to Part 2: Automation. Each functionality listed uses a module or function in the python built-in library to be called and used
