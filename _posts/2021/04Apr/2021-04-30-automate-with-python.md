This course is long and lenghty/extensive. A lot of ground is covered and some concepts are best learnt when situations arise when that concept needs to be implemented. Nonetheless, it's best to be through.

The book is beginner friendly. It leads with Part 1: Basics, covering different data types of python, <!--(terms and keywords used while working in python)--> functions and methods.
Without wasting anything it moves to Part 2: Automation. Each functionality listed uses a module or function in the python built-in library to be called and used 


1. pattern matching w/ regex,
2. reading, writing and organising Files, 
3. web scraping, 
4. working with 
	1. excel spreadsheets,
	2. pdf & word docs and 
	3. CSV & JSON files
5. scheduling tasks, launching programs
6. sending email, text messages
7. image manipulation
8. controlling keyboard and mouse w/ GUI automation


From all the functionalities discussed in Part 2 of the book, the respective functions exists as a method in a module. 
For the regex pattern matching, the module used is re and methods tlked about are compile(), search(), findall(), and sub(). For file management, module: os and methods are path.join(), getcwd(), chdir(), makedir(). Reading and writing files, set variable with open() [with a mode if it's writing, no mode specified is reading] function and perform action on the variable like read(), write() and close() to the file. And so on and so forth..

Repetitive explaination gives me PTSD from learning in the same way from college in the most dry manner. Practical use case is essential. The modules and methods can be referred when it's required. Just learning by focusing each chapter one functionality at a time will prove disastrous wrt time. Casual reference and trial by fire for each of the function can be seen as the most efficient way to cover the topics.

Since I can write simple to intermediate programs using python, I can move along to more important aspects of security. I once read a quote somewhere about learning secuirty:

```
KEY to learning security concepts: when getting a bit too comfy it's a SIGNAL means you have to move on
```
