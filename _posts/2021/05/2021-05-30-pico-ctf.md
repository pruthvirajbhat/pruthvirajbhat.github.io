This post is an intro into picoCTF - creating an account and working with all the CTF challenges the platform has. Firstly. the account was created and the basic-file-exploit was done (as shown in the john hammond walkthrough video). \
More and more CTF activities exist with resources about different topics to learn from. \
Same as hackthebox or any other platform to explore and begin working there too (like CTFlearn).
