__TL;DR__: Doing numerous tryhackme rooms, online CTFs and textbook reading to get the foundations right & clear

After working on [bandit overthewire](/2021-05-17-bandit-challenge/), the sky was the limit to work on this topic for a while. There are many places to learn Linux from. It's free in every sense of the word and so are the resources to learn and use. Numerous rooms are dedicated on _tryhackme_ for Linux. There's a textbook called [_Linux Basics for Hackers_ from OccupyTheWeb](https://booktree.ng/download/linux-basics-for-hackers/) which was a great resource for security POV learners/enthusiasts. It's important to get a POV for learning such a big topic like Linux. The sheer knowledge for Linux is as deep as the Pacific and it's easy to get lost in the ocean.
