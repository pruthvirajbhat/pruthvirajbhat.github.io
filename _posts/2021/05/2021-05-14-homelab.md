As of post writing, 14th May 2021: It's not a homelab per se, more of a "few things I have".
Currently I own a Lenovo Laptop Ideapad 320 i5 8th gen processor (8 GB RAM DDR4, 1 TB HDD) and 13 year old desktop PC (with pentium processor, 2 GB RAM DDR3 and 500 GB HDD).

On my primary system, the Laptop: I had Windows 10, but removed it entirely and wanted to dive deep into Linux. So, I installed Ubuntu as my base OS. It was torture at the beginning, now it's heaven.

Can't have any VM running smoothly, with a base OS on ubuntu. The base OS freezes (low RAM and computing power) and can't have the advantage of 2 machines on 1 system.

The old desktop PC had a Windows 7 on it. Removed it to install Debian 11 Bullseye for 32 bit pc with Xfce Desktop Environment (lightest of the Debian variants).

In Aug 2021, I got a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB RAM, few 32 GB SD Cards and a 500GB SSD.\
I'm on a tight budget, the rPI4 was a big deal on my bank account.

## Homelab
With time, I'll grow my homelab with the things I have (as of now writing: end of 2021). But I'll make do with the things I have.\
When I get a new job in security I'll treat myself with a good workstation and start making and breaking things!
