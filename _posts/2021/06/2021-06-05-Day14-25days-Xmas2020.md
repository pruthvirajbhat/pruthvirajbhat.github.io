At long last, TCM's Room! Cute poem at the beginning.

Day 14 `Open Source INTelligence` \
This was easily the most fun and most creepy stuff I've done. Information hopping from one place to another, finding more about clues here in the account profile, comments and tweets were very interesting. Especially, the image metadata viewer - the websites were removed and had to scramable to other places where data could be obtained.

The pawned aspect of the mail was difficult to pinpoint, but was done notheless. The map part felt super creepy and super slippery yet missing out specifically in the number of street there, cause there were multiple hotels of the same name around. But could pinpoint to get the answer.

### Inference
Most of the OSINT procedures felt new to do, but had seen these being done in countless movies..! Just keep looking and taking notes. The clues and flags are available everywhere.
